Hello Reader ! 

It is a Railway Ticket Reservation and Booking System Website made using 
Python, Django, Html, Css and Js.

Here I have been using the following techniques :-
 * Django as a Python Web Framework for backend development.
 
 * HTML and CSS for front-end styling. 
 
 * I have used Visual Studio Code as respective
   python IDE.
